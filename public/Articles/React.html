          <p>React was first released on May 29, 2013, and is now the most popular library for front end web development. But how did
          it become so popular and why do so many developers today use it on such a regular basis? In the following peace of line
           I will share with you 4 reason that makes attached to this Facebook Child </p>

          
          <h2 class="section-heading">1-Virtual DOM</h2>
          

          <p>Working with Vanilla Javascript was cool , but one point that I have been always critisizing is the refesh page that  we see while navigating in the webiste  </p>

          <p>First , let me tell you  a little bit about DOM (Document Object Model) , you can think of it as a place wehere all the object of a web page are stored in  a tree-like structure</p>
          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="https://i.ibb.co/T8zmMzk/virtual.jpg" alt="">
          </a>

          <!-- <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote> -->

          <p>JavaScript have to reload all the Real DOM , so he can update one elemenet of it , that's why you have to load your page to see that you profile  name is Succefully changed  in the website , until the React comes in </p>

          

          <p>Now, you  can Imagine Virtual DOM like a copy of the DOM ,but the virtual DOM doesn’t actually change anything that you see on the screen which is why it’s so fast. Essentially, the virtual DOM is like taking a screenshot of the real DOM and then saving it later.</p>

          <p>Once the virtual DOM updates, it compares the updated version with a previous version of the virtual DOM. React then
          compares both versions of the virtual DOM to see what has changed through a process known as diffing and only applies
          those changes to the real DOM.</p>
               
          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="https://i.ibb.co/rmCgwsG/DOM.png" alt="">
          </a>

        <h2 class="section-heading">2-JSX</h2>
          <p>Jsx (JavaScript Xml) is a unifide syntax that makes web development much easier , becasuse it actuality combine Regular HTML and Javascript and put them both in same package </p>
         
          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src=" https://i.ibb.co/Vgvg3FK/jhon.png" alt="">
          </a>


          <p>As you can see , "hello Jhon Doe" is what will be displayed on page , with jsx you can write function write logical script , use while , for loop , if else ..... <br>
              You’ll notice that we still use camel case when using JSX, this is because JSX is still more similar to JavaScript than
              it is to HTML
              you can learn more about Jsx in  <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">React officiall documentaion</a> React officiall documentaion
           </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">3-React is a Library</h2>
            
            <p>Over the past few years, React has exploded in popularity and is now the #1 JavaScript library out there today. Take
              a look at how React stacks up against other libraries and frameworks that are also popular</p>
            
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/PNYDvJZ/statistique.png" class="img-fluid"  alt="">

            <p>As you can see, there’s basically nobody who hasn’t heard of React and only a small percentage of those don’t have an
            interest in it or wouldn’t use it again. React’s popularity comes from its speed (Virtual DOM), reusable components,
            easy learning curve, and its developer tools and support. This also means that if you’re looking for employment, React
            is going to be your best choice when it comes to other libraries and frameworks out there</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">5-Mobile Apps With React Native</h2>

            <p>Although it’s not exactly the same as React, React Native allows you to create mobile apps for both Android and IOS. The
            syntax isn’t exactly the same as regular React, however, React Native is still extremely similar and won’t take you long
            to learn if you’re already familiar with React or even just plain JavaScript.
            If you don’t have a Mac and have an interest in creating mobile apps for IOS, then React Native is for you. React Native
            can also be used for developing for both IOS and Android simultaneously and is written with JavaScript and JSX just like
            regular React. React Native was released back in 2015 and is still somewhat new and has lots of room to be improved and
            expanded on</p>
